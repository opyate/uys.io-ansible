To emulate a quick-and-dirty 'fresh' server which only has a user and a private key for said user.

Create an 'ubuntu' admin user as per
http://www.curvve.com/blog/guides/2013/how-to-create-multiple-amazon-ec2-keypair-logins-for-contractors-and-employees

...then copy the private key to /vagrant which will be used by Ansible.

On AWS, the PEM will be provided.
I don't know about Azure.
